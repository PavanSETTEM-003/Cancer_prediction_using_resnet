# Pneumonia_prediction_using_resnet
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based method for detecting pneumonia in chest x-ray images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with ResNet architecture. Pneumonia, a lung infection that causes inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, can be challenging to diagnose solely based on chest x-ray images. By training the CNN on a dataset of labeled chest x-ray images, our goal is to improve the accuracy of pneumonia detection. The trained CNN will be used to classify new images as normal or pneumonia, and the performance will be evaluated on a test set of chest x-ray images. The ultimate goal of this project is to assist in the early and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia through the analysis of chest x-ray images using ResNet CNN architecture.

The uses of this project include:

<ul>
<li>Quickly identifying patients with pneumonia in hospitals or clinics</li>
<li>Being able to use the model in places where there are no radiologists available</li>
<li>Integrating the model into electronic health records for easy screening of patients.</li>
<li>Helping doctors understand chest x-ray images better</li>
</ul>

The dataset utilized for training and evaluating the performance of the CNN model can be accessed via the following drive link:

The dataset includes a diverse set of chest x-ray images labeled for the presence of pneumonia, which will be used to train and test the model.
